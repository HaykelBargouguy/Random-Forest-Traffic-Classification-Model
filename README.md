# Random-Forest-Traffic-Classification-Model
This project presents a Random Forest-based traffic classification model designed to classify network traffic into different categories. The model leverages the power of the Random Forest algorithm, a versatile and effective machine learning technique, to accurately predict the type of network traffic based on its features.
